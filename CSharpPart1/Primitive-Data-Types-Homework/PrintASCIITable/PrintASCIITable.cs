 * Problem 14.* Print the ASCII Table
 * Find online more information about ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) and write a
 * program to prints the entire ASCII table of characters at the console (characters from 0 to 255). Note that some
 * characters have a special purpose and will not be displayed as expected. You may skip them or display them
 * differently. You may need to use for-loops (learn in Internet how).
